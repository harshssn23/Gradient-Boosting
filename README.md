# Gradient-Boosting
Gradient Boosting is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm that is widely used for both regression and classification tasks. It belongs to the family of boosting algorithms, where weak learners (typically decision trees) are sequentially trained and combined to create a strong learner.
Gradient Boosting, in particular, builds on the principles of gradient descent optimization to minimize errors and iteratively improve the model's predictive performance.

# Regressor and Classifier Implementations

This repository contains two implementations: a regressor using the `housing.csv` dataset and a classifier using the `fatal_health.csv` dataset. Each implementation is designed to showcase the application of machine learning techniques for specific tasks.

## Regressor - Housing Price Prediction

### Overview
The regressor implementation focuses on predicting housing prices using the `housing.csv` dataset. The dataset contains various features related to housing, and the regressor employs machine learning algorithms to learn patterns and predict the prices of houses.

## Classifier - Fatal Health Prediction

### Overview
The classifier implementation is designed to predict fatal health outcomes using the fatal_health dataset. The dataset includes features related to health conditions, and the classifier utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify instances into fatal and non-fatal categories.
